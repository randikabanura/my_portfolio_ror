# PortFolio

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

## Development Environment Setup (Prerequisites)

### Rails Installation (Windows)

First, check if you already have Ruby installed. Open the command prompt and type
```ruby -v```. If Ruby responds, and if it shows a version number at or above 2.2.2, 
then type ```gem --version```. If you don't get an error, skip Install Ruby step. Otherwise,
you have to install a fresh Ruby.

#### Install Ruby

If Ruby is not installed, then download an installation package from [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/).
Follow the download link, and run the resulting installer. This is an exe file rubyinstaller-2.7.1-x-x64.exe and will be installed in a single click.
It's a very small package, and you'll get RubyGems as well along with this package.
Please check the Release Notes for more detail.

*Note: Please use ruby version 2.7.1 for this application.*

#### Install Rails

With Rubygems loaded, you can install all of Rails and its dependencies using the following command through the command line:

*Note: Please use rails version 6.0.3 for this application.*

```
> gem install rails
> rails -v

# output
> Rails 6.0.3
```
#### Database Install

Database used in this application is PostgreSQL database.
To install PostgreSQL on your computer, 
you can download it from the [official site](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
or by using the [download link for windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/). 
Once youâ€™re on the right page, click the **Download the installer** link.

After the file has been download start the installation process by clicking on the .exe file. 
Continue clicking on Next button of the installer until the password reset page of the **postgres** user.
Chose a password and continue hitting next. After all of those steps you will be able to install postgresql. 



### Rails Installation (Linux)

We are installing Ruby On Rails on Linux using rbenv. 
It is a lightweight Ruby Version Management Tool. 
The rbenv provides an easy installation procedure to manage various versions of Ruby,
and a solid environment for developing Ruby on Rails applications.

Follow the steps given below to install Ruby on Rails using rbenv tool.

#### Install Prerequisite Dependencies

First of all, we have to install git - core and some ruby dependencies that help to install Ruby on Rails.
Use the following command for installing Rails dependencies using yum.

```
$ sudo yum install -y git-core zlib zlib-devel gcc-c++ patch readline readline-devel libyaml-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel make bzip2 autoconf automake libtool bison curl sqlite-devel
```

####  Install rbenv

Now we will install rbenv and set the appropriate environment variables.
Use the following set of commands to get rbenv for git repository.

```
$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv
$ echo 'export PATH = "$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ exec $SHELL

$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
$ echo 'export PATH = "$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' << ~/.bash_profile
$ exec $SHELL
```

#### Install Ruby

Before installing Ruby, determine which version of Ruby you want to install. We will install Ruby 2.7.1.
Use the following command for installing Ruby.

*Note: Please use ruby version 2.7.1 for this application.*

```
$ rbenv install -v 2.7.1

$ rbenv global 2.2.3
$ ruby -v

# output
$ ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c) [x86_64-linux]
```

Ruby provides a keyword gem for installing the supported dependencies; we call them gems. 
If you don't want to install the documentation for Ruby-gems, then use the following command.

```
$ echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc
$ gem install bundler
```

#### Install Rails

Use the following command for installing Rails version 6.0.3.

*Note: Please use rails version 6.0.3 for this application.*

```
$ install rails -v 6.0.3
$ rbenv rehash
$ rails -v

# output
$ Rails 6.0.3
```
#### Install JavaScript Runtime

Ruby on Rails framework requires JavaScript Runtime Environment (Node.js) to manage the features of Rails. 
Next, we will see how we can use Node.js to manage Asset Pipeline which is a Rails feature.
```
$ sudo yum -y install epel-release
$ sudo yum install nodejs
```

#### Database Install

Database used in this application is PostgreSQL database.
Therefore use the following commands to install PostgreSQL.

```
$ sudo postgresql-setup initdb
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql
$ sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

Please change the password of the **postgres** user or create new user with
```CREATEDB``` privileges.
